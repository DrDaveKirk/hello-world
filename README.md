1. INTRODUCTIONS

Hi, I'm Dr David Kirk - I'm a science writer working with the Computer-Aided Biology Community [https://wwww.computeraidedbiology.com]. I'm a molecular microbiologist by training, but the research world is turning more and more to computer-aided tools for experimental design (DoE, for the initiated) and data analysis. Not to mention there's the whole automation side of things that, although we tend to leave that to the real software engineers, we should still provide input to ensure experimental execution is robust, reliable and replicable.

2. APOLOGIES

I have no idea how to code. I know nothing about coding languages. And yet! Here I am writing about the importance of Bayesian optimization in machine learning. I also know incredibly little about convoluted neural networks, machine learning and deep learning (ML & DL to their friends). I may have had a notion of html for Wordpress once upon a time, but my html reference manual is about 20 years old now.

3. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT I DO

I write about developments in the field of synthetic biology/engineering biology/biodesign/biotech 2.0 - whatever you want to call it. As biology trends towards becoming a more engineering-like and precision discipline, more computer-aided design tools are being implemented from the design phase, through the experimental execution, and then to data handling, analysis and eventually feeding that back into the design process again. Design - Build - Test - Learn cycles.

4. A BRIEFER OVERVIEW OF WHY I AM DOING IT

I love writing about it, and if I can help companies get their communications right and help communities like the CAB Community to grow, then I'm doing what I love.

5. *ahem* -- ATTENTION NERDS!

We need you, the researchers and software developers working to expand our understanding of the world and develop world-changing products, to share your stories with the CAB Community and to help boost life science as a whole. Largely, researchers are still afraid to adopt these tools - because change is different, and there's no barrier more difficult to overcome than the unknown. Reach out to me at communications@computeraidedbiology.com to talk about contributing!

6. CLOSING STATEMENT / FINAL THOUGHTS / SUMMARY.EXE / TL;DR 

I'm a science writer working with automation and software experts in the life sciences with  Bio-CAD/Computer-aided Biology. I want to share your stories about problems you've solved, cool stuff being developed and how this is going to change the face of biological research. Get in touch with me at communications@computeraidedbiology.com
